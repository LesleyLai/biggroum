Hi Banjo,

could you deploy the new containers for the BigGroum search?

# Docker compose file: 
<ATTACH>


# Resources for the containers:

Image name and tag: biggroum_search:0.2
Memory allocation: 2048MB
CPU needs: 4 CPUS
Persistent disk size: 10GB

Image name and tag: biggroum_solr:0.2
Memory allocation: 2048MB
CPU needs: 2 CPUS
Persistent disk size: 10GB

Image name and tag: biggroum_srcfinder:0.2
Memory allocation: 2048MB
CPU needs: 2 CPUS
Persistent disk size: 10GB

Image name and tag: biggroum_frontend:0.2
Memory allocation: 2048MB
CPU needs: 2 CPUS
Persistent disk size: 10GB


# Data to attach to the containers
The containers for *biggroum_search* and *biggroum_solr* mount two data stores in the /persist folder of the container (see the docker-compose.yml)
Could you download and link the data for them? (the one I sent you last time is stale)

1. For the biggroum_solr container
Download the archive solr_groum.tar.bz2 here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LG2e_YMf6ms3ri7s-N34MhaIyfsFYwWD/view?usp=sharing
Extract the archive (tar xjf solr_groum.tar.bz2) and mount the folder solr_groum to the /persist folder in the biggroum_solr container.

2. For the biggroum_search container
Download the archive solr_groum.tar.bz2 here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I43XNDa7ma5niPUsWVh1qEHhGy781sVH/view?usp=sharing
Extract the archive (tar xjf sitevisit_extraction.tar.bz2) and mount the folder solr_groum to the /persist folder in the biggroum_search container.

The extraction of this file will take some time to finish.

Note: In the docker-compose.yml I cannot set the exact path of the mounted volumes since I don't know where you're going to extract the archive on the filesystem.
For example the docker-compose.yml contains:

volumes:
- ./solr_groum:/persist

If you have a default path where you are extracting the solr_groum folder I can update the scripts on my end.
This will be useful to avoid you from editing the file.


Thank you,
Sergio


PS: In the docker-compose file the container communicates through their internal network (e.g., the biggroum_frontend container communicates with the srcfinder container on port 8080).
This works because the deployment is done with the docker-compose file.

Does it work also for the deployment on the two-six labs infrastructure?
